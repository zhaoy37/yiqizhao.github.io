abstract: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) are widely used in automated verification, but there is a
lack of interactive tools designed for educational purposes in this field.
To address this gap, we present EduSAT, a pedagogical tool specifically developed to support learning and understanding of SAT and SMT
solving. EduSAT offers implementations of key algorithms such as the
Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm and the Reduced
Order Binary Decision Diagram (ROBDD) for SAT solving. Additionally,
EduSAT provides solver abstractions for five NP-complete problems be-
yond SAT and SMT. Users can benefit from EduSAT by experimenting,
analyzing, and validating their understanding of SAT and SMT solving
techniques. Our tool is accompanied by comprehensive documentation
and tutorials, extensive testing, and practical features such as a natural
language interface and SAT and SMT formula generators, which also
serve as a valuable opportunity for learners to deepen their understand-
ing. Our evaluation of EduSAT demonstrates its high accuracy, achieving
100% correctness across all the implemented SAT and SMT solvers. We
release EduSAT as a python package in .whl file, and the source can be
identified at https://github.com/zhaoy37/SAT_Solver.
